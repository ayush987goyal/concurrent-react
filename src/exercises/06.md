# Suspense with a custom hook

## Background

React Hooks are amazing. Combine them with React Suspense, and you get some
really awesome APIs.

## Exercise

In this exercise, you're going to create a `usePokemonResource` with the
following API:

```javascript
const [pokemonResource, isPending] = usePokemonResource(pokemonName)
```

This way users of your hook don't need to bother calling `startTransition` or
anything. Your custom hook will take care of that. Any time the `pokemonName`
changes, your hook will trigger an update to the pokemonResource.

Note: Currently there are two bugs you'll want to be aware of:

- https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/17272: Have to `useLayoutEffect` and
  cannot `useEffect` currently
- https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/17273: Cannot include
  `startTransition` in the effect dependency array
