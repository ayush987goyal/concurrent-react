## Emoji

- **Kody the Koala Bear** 🐨 "Do this"

## Disclaimers

1. React Concurrent Mode is experimental
2. I've never shipped Concurrent Mode to production, and you shouldn't either
   (yet)
3. React Suspense is a particularly primitive API and we're still working out
   good abstractions for it
4. I've been informed that the API for suspending _will change_ before the
   stable release (don't worry though, the concepts are solid)
5. I will probably say "I don't know" as a response to your questions sometimes
